# Implementation

OK side constraints from views
OK check the suitability of resource oriented constraints
- Store the generated test cases for a later replay
- Fuzzer satisfying core constraints to complete speed evaluation
- test with problem instead of solved instances

# Evaluation

- tests using pre-defined test cases (1k per test campaign)
- tests against un-solved instances
- aggregate bugs by nature
- test the effects of empty sets

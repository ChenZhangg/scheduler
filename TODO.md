## Parser
OK function operator for *current value*
OK set in extension
OK set in comprehension
OK constraints as function
OK error reporting
OK simplify type system
OK validate every constraint
OK discrete & continuous constraints (an operator for current && end status ?): problem with marshalling
NO predicates

## Reducer ##
OK Reduce plan (less actions)
- Reduce signature ? (lighter constraints)
  -> split in half every set in parameters  
- Reduce source ? (less elements, constraints)
  -> remove elements not involved in the constraints signature.
     -> VMs in first
     -> nodes after

## Test case generator
- Quantify the quality of the fuzzer ?
- Symbolic execution ?

# Bug finding
- checker
- local search
- generification
